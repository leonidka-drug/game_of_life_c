With is my project on C language.
Terminal version of The Game Of Life.
To compile this you need to use -lncurses flag with gcc like (gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -o game_of_life game_of_life.c -lncurses)
After compiling you can use as usual ./game_of_life or can turn stdin flow to the program like (./game_of_life < file_2.txt)
and run program with prepaired configurations.
